# Clustering
In this project, I will describe and discover structure in my wrangled dataset, train and validate my <i>clustering</i> models, and interpret the best model in a professional quality report. For each significant step, I will document the results, interpretations, assumptions, and process.

Basically, I will go through <b>hierarchical</b> and <b>K-means</b> clustering methods in this project.
